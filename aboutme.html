                    <p>Hi! I’m Maryam, a self-taught coder working with Python, Java, and JavaScript. Outside of code, I like making colorful embroidery pieces featuring mushrooms, flowers, and some of my favorite quotes. I love visiting overlooked historic locations to photograph and taking Polaroid photos of tiny parts of my everyday life. I also enjoy reading fiction—whether it’s fantasy, classics, or thrillers—because it opens my mind to new worlds and lets me step into other people’s shoes for some time. I adore listening to music from other cultures, sometimes in languages I can’t understand, and I unwind by playing Stardew Valley.
